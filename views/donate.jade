            strong The Ethereum Foundation’s mission 
            | is to promote and support research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols and tools to the world that empower developers to produce next generation decentralized applications and together build a more globally accessible, more free and more trustworthy Internet.

          h3 Bitcoin and Ether donations

          p We've set up a special contract account to handle all donations. All funds received and any proposal to spend it are visible on the blockchain for anyone to see. Before any funds can be spent they need to be added as a proposal by a Foundation member, which needs then to be voted on by the members of the governing board. The process is fully transparent and governed by fraud-proof rules programmed on the blockchain, so you'll know your donations will be well taken care of.

          p 
            strong Also, donating might get you a unicorn. 
            | As a playful way to thank the donors, we created a token on the ethereum blockchain called the "Unicorn". Any donation over 2.014 ethers will trigger the creation of a brand new unicorn that will be automatically sent to the donor. The unicorn token can be used as any other token: it can be sent to friends or to other wallets and can be used with other ethereum contracts.
