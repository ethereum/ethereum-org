          h2 Thanks for wanting to help!

          p The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization registered in Switzerland, formed to be the custodian of the funds generated on the 2014 pre-sale and is one of the main funders of open source development in the ethereum ecossystem. You can [read more about its mission and structure on the foundation page](./foundation).

          p There are many ways to help our work.

          p We've set up a special contract account to handle all donations. All funds received and any proposal to spend it are visible on the blockchain for anyone to see. Before any funds can be spent they need to be added as a proposal by a Foundation member, which needs then to be voted on by the members of the governing board. The process is fully transparent and governed by fraud-proof rules programmed on the blockchain, so you'll know your donations will be well taken care of.

          p Also, donating might get you a unicorn. As a playful way to thank the donors, we created a token on the ethereum blockchain called the "Unicorn". Any donation over 2.014 ethers will trigger the creation of a brand new unicorn that will be automatically sent to the donor. The unicorn token can be used as any other token: it can be sent to friends or to other wallets and can be used with other ethereum contracts.
