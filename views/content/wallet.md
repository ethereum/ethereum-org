Ethereum Wallet allows you to receive and transfer ether or any ethereum compatible token, as well as allowing you to deploy a contract or interact with any smart contract deployed on the network. The Wallet supports the Main ethereum chain, test chains and even private networks.

Running the wallet app and thereby having the whole blockchain on your computer is called running a "full node". This is crucial to the success of blockchains because your are participating in the network that ensures that there is a single truth.
