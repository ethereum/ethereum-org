Guidelines for Third Parties Using Ethereum Trademarks
-------------------

We are revising those guidelines in order to have a more open approach towards the use of the Ethereum logo that is more community-friendly and supports the greater Ethereum and crypto innovation ecosystem. 

The Ethereum Foundation may be releasing a special seal for use by approved people or entities for foundation specific advocacy, fundraising, and mission-related efforts; more details will be announced.
