+ **Use of Donations.**  Donations are used for general purposes to support the Foundation.  If you want your donation to be used for specific Foundation-supported work, you would need to contact the Foundation at [donate@ethereum.org](mailto:donate@ethereum.org) and receive written confirmation that the designated donation is possible before you donate.  
 
+ **Non tax deductible contribution.**  The Foundation is recognised as a non-profit Stiftung in Switzerland.  It is not, however, recognised as a charity and is therefore not exempt from Swiss federal and cantonal income taxes.  A donation to the Foundation does not qualify as a tax deductible charitable contribution.  

    For more information on specific tax benefits to which you may be entitled through your contribution, you should check with a professional tax advisor or attorney. 

+ **No cancellations, changes or refunds.**   Before completing your donations, it is very important that you check and double check the address, the amount and other information you provide.  We are sorry but we cannot accept requests to cancel, change or refund donations.
 
+ **Illegal Funds.**  The Foundation cannot and does not accept funds that have been illegally obtained or that would otherwise be judged to damage the reputation or integrity of the Foundation. By checking the box below, you confirm that to the best of your knowledge, the donation comes from a legal source and is compliant with the tax laws of your applicable jurisdiction. Once you check the box, the Bitcoin and Ether addresses for donations will appear below. 

+ **Security.**  For online donations through the blockchain, your transaction would be securely pushed through to the address you provide.  The security of your transaction would depend on your safe keeping over your private keys and proper security practices with your computer. Please remember that the blockchain is decentralized so you must be very careful with inputting the address.  If you send currency to the wrong address, there is no centralized bank or other authority that can retrieve that currency for you. 
 
+ **Handling of personal information.**  Any personal information provided by donors will be kept strictly confidential.  The information is used only to process transactions and for Foundation audit purposes.  To the extent permissible by law, we would not disclose the information or use it for any other purposes.
