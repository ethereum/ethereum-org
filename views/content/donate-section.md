Also, donating might get you a unicorn. As a playful way to thank the donors, we created a token on the ethereum blockchain called a &ldquo;Unicorn.&rdquo;. Any donation over 2.014 ethers will trigger the creation of a brand new unicorn that will be automatically sent to the donor. Unicorns are fun tokens with no assigned value and you can watch your Unicorns through your Ethereum Wallet [here's how](#watch). They are part of an ethereum contract so they are only generated for donations of ether on the ethereum blockchain as a fun deminimus thank you.
