#### About Unicorns

+ Any donation over 2.014 ethers will trigger the creation of a brand new unicorn that will be automatically sent to the donation address.

+ If you send donations through exchanges or payment services, the Unicorn will be sent to **their** address and only they can retrieve it for you (they probably won’t do it for you).  So if you want the Unicorn, make sure you send it from an address that you directly and fully control.

+ Since Unicorns are part of an ethereum contract, they are only generated for donations of ether on the ethereum blockchain.  

+ Unicorns are fun tokens with de minimis value (no cash equivalent or redeemable value), and you can watch your Unicorns through your Ethereum Wallet ([here's how](#watch)).
