#### About Unicorns

+ Any donation over 2.014 ethers will trigger the creation of a brand new unicorn that will be automatically sent to the donation address. 

+ If you send donations through exchanges or payment services, the Unicorn will be sent to **their** address and only they can retrieve it for you (they probably wonâ€™t do it for you).  So if you want the Unicorn, make sure you send it from an address that you directly and fully control.

+ Since Unicorns are part of an ethereum contract, they are only generated for donations of ether on the ethereum blockchain.  

+ Unicorns are fun tokens with de minimis value (no cash equivalent or redeemable value), and you can watch your Unicorns through your Ethereum Wallet ([here's how](#watch)).
