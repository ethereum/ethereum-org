  p Ether is the internal 'fuel' of Ethereum. Programs running on Ethereum need to pay the network for the resources they consume. Volunteers earn this ether by validating transactions, securing the network.

  p Alternatively, if you participated in the presale to fund Ethereum's development, or won a reward from the Olympic or 
    a(href="https://bounty.ethdev.com/") Bug Bounty 
    | programs, you will have a wallet file (.json) that can be imported and give you access to your ether.
  
  p You can also get some from a friend or purchase it online.

    | Kickstart a project with a trustless crowdsale

  p Do you already have many ideas as to what to develop on Ethereum? Maybe you need help and some funds to bring them to life, but who would lend money to someone they don’t trust?

  p Using Ethereum you can create a contract that will hold contributors' money until any given date or goal is reached. Depending on the outcome, the funds will either be released to the project owners, or safely returned back to the contributors. All without requiring a centralized arbitrator, clearing house or having to trust anyone.

  p You can even use the token you created earlier to keep track of the distribution of rewards.

    | Create a democratic autonomous organization

  p Now that you have developed your idea and secured funds, what’s next? You have to hire managers, find a trustworthy CFO to handle the accounts, run Board meetings and do a bunch of paperwork.

  p Or you can simply leave all that to an Ethereum contract. It will collect proposals from your backers, and submit them through a completely transparent voting process.

  p One of the many advantages of having a robot run your organization, is that it is immune to any outside influence as it’s guaranteed to execute only what it was programmed to. And because the Ethereum network is decentralized, you'll be able to provide services with an 100% uptime guarantee.
