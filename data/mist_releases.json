hard on a solution to balance decentralization with user experience.\r\n\r\nWhile running a full node is important to the health of the network, we all know the weight of doing so on a consumer machine. Amazing services, like Infura, can help you get connected immediately but introduces new risks.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Ethereum Wallet and Mist beta have prioritized running a local ethereum node, helping relay blocks and keep the pulse of the ethereum blockchain worldwide. \r\n\r\nToday, we are introducing a hybrid solution that brings the swiftness of Infura with the power and security of running your own Geth node. After connecting immediately to a remote node, your local node takes over all subscriptions and filters once it's up to date.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47108/42292491-4c07afda-7fa9-11e8-85b0-0f6c9ac55e3c.gif\" width=\"400\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n*Connected to Infura remote node, while local light node syncs in the background. The light client eventually becomes the main connection to the blockchain.*\r\n\r\nWithin Mist, some UI has been introduced to let you know which node is active, local node sync progress, and other network and sync details.\r\n\r\n### What does this all mean? No more endless sync! 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Updates\r\n- Wallet is now served locally in Mist Browser, instead of https://wallet.ethereum.org.\r\n- Major refactor in Mist internal state, using Redux.\r\n- Linux .deb builds are back.\r\n- Optimized update checker.\r\n- A token scan button on Ethereum Wallet.\r\n- Updated to Web3 1.0.\r\n- Partial migration from Meteor to React.\r\n\r\nRead more about this release and following steps:\r\nhttps://medium.com/@omgwtfmarc/the-future-of-ethereums-mist-browser-layered-nodes-and-beyond-54dd1e70d375\r\n\r\n\r\nFile | Checksum (SHA256)\r\n  -- | -- \r\n<sub>Ethereum-Wallet-installer-0-11-0.exe</sub> | <sub>`44cafa7b7bb645e4d0afb5915638eb0ef187b97556bfe335294cd4696abe4fae2`</sub>\r\n<sub>Ethereum-Wallet-linux32-0-11-0.deb</sub> | <sub>`3881e2156da96e52f832f7d559d785a50de42577fcfacd5b39dee0fac436cd14`</sub>\r\n<sub>Ethereum-Wallet-linux32-0-11-0.zip</sub> | <sub>`6bf2814f34dd27b08122f200810c7aaba5bc44143f3feab0ee9b96dfa4ae0628`</sub>\r\n<sub>Ethereum-Wallet-linux64-0-11-0.deb</sub> | <sub>`a601608a2009a8fc2befc11c6132399dc5d2b90c72d6e05517d13860f7190291`</sub>\r\n<sub>Ethereum-Wallet-linux64-0-11-0.zip</sub> | <sub>`8c7bf7a9c6b46c2f4a6d7f9958524e7f0deb8dc6bd886c6b9ba732b4235be165`</sub>\r\n<sub>Ethereum-Wallet-macosx-0-11-0.dmg</sub> | <sub>`e3715fa1becb2ef3caae9b1e9f84f7d971b667c2421fb30607a57be7fb7d95cd`</sub>\r\n<sub>Ethereum-Wallet-win32-0-11-0.zip</sub> | <sub>`4f3e86869f4b4c744f7a2c11b00cbc4ce639e6c4c118219d1a47aa1522f01d537`</sub>\r\n<sub>Ethereum-Wallet-win64-0-11-0.zip</sub> | <sub>`4ef2a8def72f45d2613db2371454fa1c675ebb58ab3f3a3b67a1798d0e7bb8f45`</sub>\r\n<sub>Mist-installer-0-11-0.exe</sub> | <sub>`46e843e66b507a6e0f4fd8efac408e09fbe8f02fb4ee1ba867492bbfe020e27df`</sub>\r\n<sub>Mist-linux32-0-11-0.deb</sub> | <sub>`c26b1deccf355e93ed0ff854cb6024eaedd3a545b31b08bb1aabd09457fb67a7`</sub>\r\n<sub>Mist-linux32-0-11-0.zip</sub> | <sub>`da2e0d3bb0317d7840b9dd22f4ccc2593c352c7034507e48be97a7ad44deeefe`</sub>\r\n<sub>Mist-linux64-0-11-0.deb</sub> | <sub>`07c400d322908c40546eece2a6e1e622a7b00f18b238e4de334854046a68f0d2`</sub>\r\n<sub>Mist-linux64-0-11-0.zip</sub> | <sub>`756cf6a834570879a39438f75a892b3bded7bd935a81a49b36b24263596fa9dc`</sub>\r\n<sub>Mist-macosx-0-11-0.dmg</sub> | <sub>`45931ab04707121a4e87a2f546c00ca968e6484ddc4b68eebc2165cf9b364d69`</sub>\r\n<sub>Mist-win32-0-11-0.zip</sub> | <sub>`4d78b395f935f1389f33da9e2325b5aa9339a134a5a97ca00cdeab0ad6dc4adce`</sub>\r\n<sub>Mist-win64-0-11-0.zip</sub> | <sub>`433446da72306d24312a82571a06a2a6e745730d6321fb52a09a2212d18ed1106`</sub>\r\n<sub>Mist-win64-0-11-0.zip</sub> | <sub>`433446da72306d24312a82571a06a2a6e745730d6321fb52a09a2212d18ed1106`</sub>"}
