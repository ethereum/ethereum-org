release adds some anticipated features and also addresses important security improvements.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT FOR DAPP DEVELOPERS!** *Read the notes below about changes in Mist's `web3` object!*\r\n\r\n## Mist Browser\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47108/28197797-aaa6732e-682f-11e7-9184-19e39697e2cc.png\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Swarm support<sup>beta</sup>\r\nIt is now possible to navigate through the Swarm decentralized network with the `bzz://` protocol. Every request lands on the Swarm node, which will search for the content through the p2p network and display your website/file of choice.\r\n\r\nBasically, it means that if you point your ENS domain to a swarm hash, the swarm content can be accessed on Mist via `bzz://mydomain.eth`. How cool is that? New web, much wow 😎\r\n\r\nAlso, in order to upload files and folders on Mist is as easy as `File > Upload to Swarm...`.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that in order to use ENS domains, your chain has to be synced, as it looks up to ENS resolver contracts.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the project, head to *bzz://theswarm.eth* — after updating Mist, of course.\r\nKudos to @zelig and Swarm team.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Security hardening\r\nIncreased security by leveraging the use of a fully isolated JavaScript context between Mist and the Dapps. See #2087.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**NOTE FOR DAPP DEVELOPERS!**\r\n\r\nFrom this version on Mist will not ship its own `web3.js` instance anymore. We only provide for now `web3.currentProvider` so you can connect to ethereum. In the future, we will provide a special `ethereum` object with a default provider.\r\n\r\nAlso this `web3.currentProvider` will not allow sync calls anymore, as it is already the case in MetaMask (and it's bad practice in general). So make sure to use the async ones e.g. `web3.eth.accounts -> web3.eth.getAccounts(function(){...})`\r\n\r\nTo instantiate your (self-included) web3.js lib you can use:\r\n```js\r\n\r\nif(typeof web3 !== 'undefined')\r\n    var web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);\r\nelse\r\n    web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\"http://localhost:8545\"));\r\n```\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Easier test networks\r\nIn addition to Ropsten, you can now switch to the Rinkeby test network from the Develop menu. *Rinkeby is also set as the default testnet*, as it is much lighter to sync. See #2723.\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to create your own solo network for testing purposes (or in a workshop where you have a very poor internet connection) you can also do it directly via the Develop menu: it will create a local network just for your computer in which you can test, mine and publish local contracts. It will use the `--dev` flag on your Geth node. From the Mist UI console (developer tools), you can use and control the `web3` object.\r\nSee (command line options)[https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options]. #2723.\r\n\r\nAn in-depth view of the Mist 0.9.0 changelog:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/mist/milestone/18?closed=1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ethereum Wallet\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47108/28134552-ad04c16e-6719-11e7-8d80-316d8285ac4d.gif\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; display: block\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### ENS support for addresses\r\nYou can write an ENS address on any address field on the Wallet, and the actual address represented by that name will appear when you click outside of the field. \r\n\r\nIt will even double check the name and can redirect to preferred names, so if you type \"ethereum\" it will see that it points to the address of the Ethereum Foundation tip-jar, which calls itself \"ethereumfoundation\".\r\n\r\nAccounts also do reverse name lookup: if any of your accounts, wallets or contracts have registered a reverse name lookup, then they will be shown the ENS name in your app. \r\n\r\nThe meteor package containing this special input type is publicly available at [Meteor Package Elements](https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-package-elements), made by @alexvandesande, so you can use it on your Dapp _today_.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ENS support for tokens\r\n\r\nNow it's easier than ever to watch Tokens and see your balances. By clicking on Contracts > Watch Token, the modal will appear and you can type the Token symbol. Instantly all the available details will appear and you just have to confirm.\r\n\r\nThis was only possible after @kvhnuke created the big list o' tokens, and @Arachnid created `thetoken.eth` service 👏\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47108/28135235-debf5a1e-671b-11e7-87f2-4d73d80cc147.gif\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; display:

approaching, we'd like to inform that in the near future, from 0.9.0 onwards it won't inject `web3` object by default on Dapps. This is a measure to keep Dapps stable on the long run as ethereum ecosystem evolves. We'll provide a developer preview version, so Dapp developers will have time to update their Dapps accordingly._\r\n\r\n_The `web3.currentProvider` object will still remain for a period of time for backwards compatibility and a new provider object will be introduced._\r\n\r\n### 0.8.10\r\n- This version features a whole new and sidebar, giving people more room to browse, while presenting the Dapps in a beautifully, more prominent way. \r\n\r\n- Fixes a bug that made tabs disappear for some users.\r\n\r\n- Reinforced the need of backing up keystores.\r\n\r\n- Improved password strength validation when creating accounts. From now on, the passwords should have at least 8 characters.\r\n\r\n- Fixed wallet importing issue.\r\n\r\n⚠️ **As Mist is still under a security audit, please don't visit untrusted DApps with your Mist browser in order to reduce risks.**\r\n\r\nSee the full changelog:\r\n\r\n| PR   | Description |\r\n------ | ---------------------------------------\r\n #1753 | **i18n**: partial update to German translation\r\n #1783 | **i18n**: add missing meteor package 'numeral:languages'\r\n #1784 | **readme**: update dependencies paragraph\r\n #2067 | **Importer**: Improve console messages\r\n #2126 | **yarn**: update node-modules\r\n #2129 | **spectron**: increase timeout for \"file\" protocol should be disallowed on browser bar\r\n #1642 | **gulp**: Refactor and Ethereum-Wallet NSIS installer\r\n #2137 | **gulp**: makensis: remove debug loglevel\r\n #1751 | **ESLint**: fix simple rule violations in 'interface'\r\n #1752 | **ESLint**: exclude auto-generated 'signatures.js'\r\n #2094 | Remove .mention-bot\r\n #534  | Solidity compiler version missing\r\n #714  | Error/infinite import of wallet-file\r\n #1050 | Show hint on node related menu labels if external node is used\r\n #1489 | Wallet tab losing attributes\r\n #1640 | Sidebar revamp\r\n #1641 | Persisting main window bounds\r\n #1647 | Sync was being skipped\r\n #1665 | Updates confirmation window size issue\r\n #1680 | Last days of dechunker\r\n #1682 | Language setting not persistent\r\n #1736 | Switch to camelCase for var 'lang_code'\r\n #1737 | Perm-tests: add 'bzz' to 'should only contain allowed attributes' test\r\n #1738 | Add ES6 support to the meteor interface\r\n #1749 | Enable translations on splash screen\r\n #1750 | Fix sync stops at 2% on Windows 32-bit\r\n #1775 | Show backup hint when createing accounts, demanding min 8 characters\r\n #2140 | Removing old code.

Installers**: This version includes the new installer for Windows created by @tgerring, which lets you choose the directory to install Mist in, as well as the `data-dir` of the ethereum node. It's one installer for both 32 and 64-bit computers.\n\n> _Note that the `data-dir` is set as a parameter in Mist shortcut properties, at the installation stage; not in Mist's preferences._\n- **App Signing**: Mist for Mac OS X is now signed by the Ethereum Foundation.\n- **Solidity Compiler**: Now featuring version 0.4.8.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/47108/22521532/72ec3cbc-e89f-11e6-9c5d-a5b5429595ac.gif\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Remix IDE\"/>\n</p>\n- **Remix IDE option on menu**\n  0.8.9 also has a new menu entry to open Remix IDE, so now you have plenty of room to write your contracts without leaving Mist. Head to `Develop > Open Remix IDE`.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/47108/22523802/d0f688e6-e8a7-11e6-8fbe-3d946f6c4c47.gif\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Test\"/>\n</p>\n- **A test suite is born:** It was about time for Mist to have a solid set of integration tests. Now we're starting to kill this debt with a [Spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron)-powered test suite, that uses the amazing webdriver.io to interact with the `webview` instances. \n- **Fixes offline startup edge case** #1571.\n\nSee the full changelog at [Milestone 0.8.9](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/milestone/16).\n\n## Checksums

m/mist/zipball/v0.8.8","body":"For this release Mist undergone an Audit by [Cure53](https://cure53.de), which was a very needed endeavour and we are thankful for the great expertise of the Cure53 team.\n\n## Security\n\nThis audit led to a lot of useful findings that strengthen the security of the Mist browser when interacting with external DApps.\n\n_Though we also found certain vulnerabilities in [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), which is what Mist (and others like: [Brave](https://brave.com), [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im)) uses that we can't fix fully at the current point in time, without changes on the electron side, which we communicated to them. Luckily their team is very responsive and right on track to fix those as i write._\n\n**_For now don't visit untrusted DApps with your Mist browser to reduce risk!!**_\n\nWe will hopefully in the next release be able to secure the electron vulnerabilities and provide a safe browser experience.\n\nSome of the security issues allowed:\n- Execution of simple code in the Mist interface context\n- Popping up spoofed alert windows\n- Changing the interface by dragging files into it\n- Directing to file paths (which is disabled for now, on some occasions)\n- File path attacks using HTTP redirects\n- UI breaks\n\nWe also fixed all issues on the Mist side that allowed to break the interface. We added a new 400 error page for disallowed URLs. We also improved the security of scripts running inside the DApps context and improved overall webview security. We might publish the full list of vulnerabilities at a later point in time.   \n\nBig thanks goes to @cure53 and their great team for disassembling Mist and especially its integration of third party content. We will very likely have follow up audits of more aspects of the Mist browser.\n\n## Bug fixes\n\nThis release has major stability improvements on the node connection between tabs and the stability of the sockets, which were freezing Mist at times.\n\nThe wallet was also updated and should now have the problem with the confirmation windows solved.\n\nAdditionally we fixed the following issues:\n- prompts users when there are geth updates and allows them to opt-in to update it\n- fixed flickering of icons\n- fixed directing of URLs into the browser tab\n- fixed removal of wallet tab title\n\nFull change log: https://gist.github.com/evertonfraga/d7a4c998d41463cd2a3a7eea50c61004\n\n## Checksums (SHA-256)\n\n###

See below.\n\nSome Mist API methods were exposed, making it possible that malicious webpages get access to a privileged interface that could delete files on the local filesystem or launch registered protocol handlers and obtain sensitive information, such as the user directory or the user's coinbase.\n\nPreviously vulnerable exposed Mist APIs:\n- `mist.shell`\n- `mist.dirname`\n- `mist.syncMinimongo`\n- `web3.eth.coinbase` is now null, if the account is not allowed for the dapp\n\nUpgrade to this version of the Mist Browser. Do not use any previous Mist version to navigate to any untrusted webpage, or local webpages from unknown origins. Ethereum Wallet is not affected as it doesn't allow navigation to external pages.\n\nThis is a good reminder that currently Mist is considered only for Ethereum App Development and should not be used for end users to navigate on the open web until it is reached at least version 1.0. An external audit of Mist is scheduled.\n\n**We'd like to thank the vulnerability discoverer [Tintinweb](http://github.com/tintinweb) for his responsible disclosure and remind everyone that we have a bounty program at bounty@ethereum.org**\n\n## Checksums (SHA-256)\n\n### Mist\n\n```\nf464b15ea1179efff96d81c568b5991cf09c6b846244933bf25886d95e9ce2d8

repository: \n\n> Geth 1.4.17 is a hotfix release to address two DoS attack vectors abused on the mainnet:\n> This release limits the number of transactions per-user and globally so as to limit maximum memory consumption and egress network traffic.\n\n### Changes\n\nAlso here are some changes to keep your Mist shining.\n- Update geth to 1.4.17 #1274 \n- Update _Solidity Compiler_ (Solc) to release `0.4.2` #1239 \n- Disable resizability for all popup windows #1206\n- Update github's issue-template's node.log upload instructions #1232 \n- Added Russian translation #1247 - thanks

is a bugfix-release to mitigate the sync-related issues on the main-net caused by the recent [transaction spam attack](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/09/22/transaction-spam-attack-next-steps/). Furthermore this release will fix the faulty installer introduced with pre-release `0.8.3`.\n\nFinally the new installer split the config-folder into separate ones for **Ethereum Wallet** and **Mist**. As a result Ethereum Wallet won't display any previous _watched custom contracts_ and _token_ as well as _contract wallets_ and _wallet names_. Although they are still available in Mist and Ethereum Wallet `< 0.8.3` you will need to [re-added them manually](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/1240) to Ethereum Wallet `>= 0.8.3`.\n\n### Changes\n- updated bundled geth to `1.4.14` \"What else should we rewrite?\" [pre-release](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.4.14).\n\n### Fixes\n- adds desktop-shortcut, startmenu-entry and uninstaller (windows) (#1211)\n- allow simultaneous installation of Mist and Ethereum Wallet (windows, linux) (#1213)\n- fix and update npm dependency graph (#1194)\n\n## Checksums (SHA-256)\n\n### Mist\n\n```\n33af49dc9d71a899f7e29c2ec54a2d10225dd55c536a798060e9f1f3c45633fc  Mist-linux32-0-8-4.deb\na76c71ba201b960298774f3820d6c3b680834da715243ed4c8fe779c5e92dc6a

0.8.3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/18554959/651119c6-7b3c-11e6-8db0-374920eb53c2.png)\n\nThis is a special release live from Devcon. It contains a few updates that will be presented live onstage, and the new security release for Geth.\n\n# New Features\n\n### New confirmation pane (#1141)\n\nAll ethereum transactions only contain very few pieces of information, mostly who it comes from, who it goes to, the amount of ether and the byte code data. This last one is where all the contract magic does, yet all you could see until now was a bunch of hexadecimal numbers. In this version, we try to decode the byte code into human friendly parameters, so you can understand more what the contract is trying to do. Mist comes with almost 3000 contract signatures (thanks to @pipermerriam for creating [a service that collects them](http://4byte.directory) ) and if you still don't have it you can still query the internet to try to decode it. With some upcoming Swarm and Solidity features we intend to make this request via Swarm, not HTTP, but right now if you click decode, you are sending a request to the site http://4byte.directory/ which doesn't keep any logs.\n\nDon't forget that this is just what the transaction _list_ it does. Ultimately what the contract _does_ is up to the code, so clicking the recipient address will take you to a page containing the contract source code that you can verify yourself.\n\n### Security fix\n\nThis Mist & Wallet 0.8.3 release contains the [updated 1.4.12 Geth version](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/09/18/security-alert-geth-nodes-crash-due-memory-bug/). If you were experiencing issues with Mist crashing after block 2283416, then that's the likely culprit.\n\n### PGP-verified releases (#546)\n\nThis is long-awaited, and probably more useful than checksums itself. Look for the Verified badge in releases and commits.\n\n### Other fixes\n- New windows installers and Mac DMGs\n- Changed Fullscreen shortcut (#1151) \n- Updated to the latest version of Solidity (#1138)\n- Fixed a security issue that could reveal your public key without authorisation  (#1114) \n- Integrating electron-builder for better distributables building (#1159)\n\n## Known issues\n- Mist Menu still lists geth as _1.4.10_ but it has been updated\n- Windows installers are not adding the icons on the menu. To find your mist install, open windows explorer and go to `%localappdata%\\Mist\\app-0.8.3\\`\n- Installation of Ethereum Wallet will wipe out Mist and vice versa on Windows and Linux (https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/1178; only 0.8.3 versions affected)\n\n# Checksums (SHA-256)\n\n### Mist\n\n```\n4cc5774cc6900fbcaa155705291e2f85f5568b19b8163a603e953bececac42d3  Mist Setup

Coinbase integration\n\nAnother long time coming release, but this one is packed with goodies. First of all, we are very happy with to announce a Coinbase integration: if you are in the United States, now you can buy up to $5 with a credit or debit card and transfer it to any ethereum account instantly. You'll be prompted to create a [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com) account if you don't have one already, and then log in.\n\nAs Coinbase adds more markets, they will be added to the wallet, and we are looking into how we can use their bank transfers integration to allow unlimited daily amounts. We are not getting any fees or compensation for this (unlike our ShapeShift affiliate program which sends about 0.25-0.4% to the [Ethereum Tip Jar](https://www.ethereum.org/donate)) but we are very excited to see another adoption barrier being taken down. We thank the Coinbase team for their help making this a reality.\n\n---\n\n![auth](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/17698573/57ba17bc-6392-11e6-9f1f-edf3470bd8a2.png)\n\n### New Mist accounts panel\n\nWe are changing the way accounts are made visible to a Dapp in Mist. By default, an app isn't shown any more information on the user than what it would get from browsing a normal web (which, admittedly, already leaks tons of information) so we wanted to simplify the process of revealing your accounts to the app. The new process is similar to the authentication in the Chrome browser or connecting via Facebook oauth.\n\nTo reveal your account to an app, click on the anonymous person icon, and then choose one or more accounts that will be made visible. An app can and should change it's UI to reflect the changes (but never reveal any private information as, until the user properly signs a message, they haven't proven ownership of these accounts yet).\n\n---\n\n![screen shot 2016-08-16 at 8 46 09 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/17697882/e9cfe0be-638d-11e6-8fe7-84d1aafff10a.png)\n\n### Replay prevention\n\nWe added an advanced feature to prevent your transactions on being replayed on other chains, like ethereum classic. This allows you either to prevent that transfer on happening on classic at all, or use that transaction to send the same amount to a different contract, like a newly created account or an exchange. If you want to fully separate all your transactions we recommend you create two new accounts, one for Ethereum proper and the other for Classic, and then move all your funds into them (remember that you need ether to move tokens), making sure that each account has 0 ether on the other chain - doing this once would prevent any future transaction from being replayed. To use this, use the \"more options\" button on the send page.\n\nThis feature also supports splitting tokens, but it's very experimental and will not work on all tokens. Since all of this is done using [a contract](http://etherscan.io/address/0x1ca4a86bba124426507d1ef67ad271cc5a02820a#code) then first you need to allow that contract to move tokens in your behalf by clicking \"Approve token transfer\". \n\nAs always, **these features are experimental and should be tested with small amounts first**. Although most transactions are replayed on both chains, some may not for multiple reasons. Also, some exchanges have issues receiving ether from a contract address - if that's your case, contact the exchange.\n\nWe've also removed all Fork code from the Mist app, so if you want to use it Ether Classic you'll have to either download Classic Mist directly from their [repository](https://github.com/ethereumclassic) or use your own node as the backend for your wallet (both Ethereum Wallet and Mist can connect to any node) as you would do for a private network.\n\n---\n\n### Other changes\n- Fixes blank screen at startup #1110 - This nasty bug was one of the culprits of the long delay, as it was an erratic behaviour that would only affect installs on a clean system\n- Adds a links to the contract source code on the confirmation window\n- Added contrast on dark themes #1001\n- Enabled HTTP RPC sockets (#871)\n- Fixed Tabs permissions update (#1061)\n- Fixed node download logic (#1048) \n- New wallet favicon and 404 page (ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet/263) \n\n---\n\n###

release contains **geth 1.4.10** with the Hard Fork choice!\n\nYou will be asked at start which chain you want to be on. After selecting your choice, you will run either the Hard Fork chain, or stay on the old one.\n\n![screen shot 2016-07-17 at 12 21 09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/232662/16900179/a7705a00-4c1d-11e6-8027-dfb072f89810.png)\n\nUntil block 1 920 000 you can simply switch to the other chain, by selecting the main in Menu \"Develop\" -> \"The DAO fork\" -> \"support/don't support DAO fork\".\n\n<img width=\"490\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-17 at 11 50 55\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/232662/16900180/ada1609a-4c1d-11e6-84d2-71b934c8eff0.png\">\n\nIf you want to switch chains _after block 1920000_ you need to resync Mist!\nYou can do this by following these instructions:\n- Click on \"Accounts\" -> \"Backup\" -> \"Accounts\". This will open the file explorer with the \"Ethereum\" folder opened.\n- Click on \"Accounts\" -> \"Backup\" -> \"Application Data\". This will open a system folder, go there into the \"Mist\" folder.\n- Close Mist.\n- Delete the \"chaindata\" folder inside the \"Ethereum\" folder.\n- Change the content of the file called \"daoFork\" to `true` or `false` (\"true\" means going with the dao fork, \"false\" means against). Optionally you can also simply delete that file and Mist will ask you again to choose on the next start.\n- After you done that restart Mist and it will ask you to select the chain again and you can sync\n\nOther additions in this release:\n- Fixes the bug, where estimateGas was not working anymore.\n- Fixes an issue in the transaction confirmation window in which it would show “wrong password” error, for unrelated node errors\n- Disables eth node until it releases a version with fork support\n\n**NOTE C++ `eth` has no hard fork ready version build yet, so you need to use `geth` for now, and wait until we can bundle eth in the next release!**\n\n```\nSHA256 Ethereum-Wallet-linux64-0-8-1.zip: c90ef7cdbb5f8d05e4a3c69e3851973ff878481269472f0397ef97b9bfbe397a\nSHA256

shot 2016-07-07 at 6 17 21 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/16670119/23353356-446f-11e6-8fda-7f5546645449.png)\n\nThis is a small release of the Ethereum Wallet, but a big step for Mist development as it's our first\\* public release of the Mist browser. This is the same software we've been shipping for some time now (in fact you can launch mist from the wallet using a command line flag) but we believed this would be a good time to make it available in an easier form for the general public to test and developers to start tinkering with it's possibilities.\n\n\\* You can say we started at [zero](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/tag/0.3.6)\n\n### Why?\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation believes in a more decentralised internet, one where users keep their private information and where applications can run without any centralised server, using smart contracts as their logic. The Ethereum Wallet has some basic contract functionality, but we believe that in order for smart contracts to reach their full potential, they should be as easy to use as website. \n\nSo the \"Mist Navigator\" is not meant to be a better general browser, but a starting point to access future Ethereum Applications, and this is where we will be building more functionality that goes beyond the blockchain, like decentralised file storage and p2p communication layers.\n\n### The Wallet\n\nWe are making both the traditional wallet app and the Mist Navigator. The former option includes the the wallet as a default app and you can use it in the exact same way as before. Unlike the Ethereum Wallet application which hosts all the files locally, this version is hosted at wallet.ethereum.org, a mirror of [this github repository](http://ethereum.github.io/meteor-dapp-wallet/build/) which is derived directly from the linked source code on github. These files contain only the interface files and **no information is stored at any server**. The only external connection is made to a price information server. All your private information is stored locally on your own computer and the connection to the blockchain is done via Mist. As soon as Swarm is deployed on the main net we will start distributing it this way so it will become again a local file.\n\n### How to use the Browser\n\nWe built an example application for you to interact with (we will cover more about how it works behind the scenes on a future blog post). Use Mist to navigate to that page - it will not work on a  normal browser as it keeps all information on the blockchain and not in any one server.\n\nClick Browse, paste the address  `https://ethereum.github.io/stake-voice/` on it and press enter.\n\n![captura de tela 2016-07-07 as 10 55 06 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/16670745/2cc9422e-4472-11e6-8366-17530cbb1c6d.png)\n\nStake Voice is a generic polling app, intended to be able to give Ether Stake holders an opinion on any controversial topic. It doesn't keep any ether, and all it does is verifies that a key holder indeed agrees or disagrees with that statement. The votes and balances are then tallied by the app itself and the tally is updated if any of the currently voting accounts change their balance.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is allow the app to see one of your accounts. Instead of each site having to create separate login procedures and keeping your private information, you start all mist apps anonymously and then you reveal your credentials with a few clicks. Click on the \"no accounts set\" to connect to the app, and optionally click the plus button to add it to your sidebar (we are in the process of streamlining these steps).\n\n![captura de tela 2016-07-07 as 10 56 10 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/16670975/52605440-4473-11e6-9673-d2fded7aeb68.png)\n\nNow type a statement on the text box, anything you want to know either people agree or disagree with.\n\n![captura de tela 2016-07-07 as 10 58 13 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/16671017/92730668-4473-11e6-8a49-fef5d43a1eb7.png)\n\nIf you just typed the question, chances are that nobody answered it yet. So click one of the buttons, agree or disagree and a window will pop up and ask your password. \n\n**Don't type your password blindly**. This window means that you are about to execute a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Check if it's **sending any ether** and before you confirm it and use an online tool to verify the contract source. \n\nYou can verify the source of the contracts you are interacting [here](http://etherscan.io/address/0x1e9d5e4ed8ef31cfece10b4c92c9057f991f36bc#code) and [here](http://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x47ab800a75990b0bd5bb4a54cfbec777972c973c#code). Also notice the icons on that page and check if they are identical to the ones you are seeing on the confirmation page. The icons of the latest version of the contract should look like this:\n\n![icons](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/16686469/c79b0226-44e8-11e6-99c7-1bf9d3de31ab.jpg)\n\nWe are working on making all these steps more user friendly in the future. Meanwhile we recommend you **create a new account with no tokens** to interact with unknown contracts and refuse to interact with any contract whose source code is unknown. \n\n<img width=\"1186\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-08 at 8 57 37 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/16686677/21bcf8d0-44ea-11e6-8dc9-59e5650abb52.png\">\n\n_Contract icon looks the same? Check. Ether sent is set at 0? Check._\n\nAfter you confirmed your password, wait for the next block to be picked up and in a few seconds the app will calculate everyone's current opinion on the matter. Share the link with friends to get them to answer the issues too.\n\n![captura de tela 2016-07-07 as 11 07 59 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/16671206/926d9920-4474-11e6-9b33-2ddb2ff0afe2.png)\n\nThe app stores no information on servers, so all information is saved on the blockchain and the statement is kept at the url, but since all information is public anyone can extend the app, by adding comments, lists of most voted statements and create their own interface for it. We will cover how the app works and how you can build similar apps like these in a future blog post.\n\nSome random statements you can try: [Game of Thrones vs Star Wars](https://ethereum.github.io/stake-voice/?proposal=Game%20of%20Thrones%20is%20better%20than%20Star%20Wars) and [Nutella](https://ethereum.github.io/stake-voice/?proposal=Nutella%20is%20overrated)\n\n**This is a proof of concept code and is not intended to scale**. While it can accurately depict stake holders opinions, since all calculation is done on the frontend, some very popular or controversial questions could be attacked by spammers that create thousands of dust votes. If you want to check other projects doing similar things but with the specific purpose of Fork Voting, you should check [ethersignal](https://github.com/vulcanize/ethersignal) (same basic code, but with added spam protection) and [carbonvote](http://carbonvote.com).\n\n### Known Issues\n\nMist Browser is in early stages and we decided to release it earlier than expected in the hopes that it can help build better discussion and governance tools for Ethereum. Some known bugs:\n- Sometimes tabs will lose their titles or the main page won't load. Pressing the regresh button (command+r or control+r) on the tab will solve the issue\n- A white rectangle sometimes appear at the bottom of apps. Resizing the app forces a redraw and the rectangle disappears\n- Tabs are occasionally forgotten by the application\n\n### Full Changelog\n- adding setting to change UI language (fixes #813) (#896)\n- update-popup-window: prevent maximize (#885)\n- fixed webview tagd and updated electrong to 1.2.5 (#905)\n- Fixes the node start IPC connection (#841)\n- Cleanup of i18n files (#910)\n- Fixing wallet tab insertion (#911)\n- Fully automated UI testing (#788)\n\n#### Changes to Wallet\n- Caches the contract code and ABI inputs (https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet/pull/221)\n\nSaves contract code in memory when getting out of tab: This is particularly useful when you need the address of a contract as one of the parameters for another contract (creating a dao that uses a token for example) and you want to go to another tab to copy it (Add caching to contract https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet/pull/139)\n- Fixes an issue that would prevent you from sending tokens out of a contract without ether\n- Fixes an issue that would select an account you don’t own when sending tokens from a wallet contract\n- Doesn’t allow you to deploy contracts from wallet

vulnerability release.\n\nThis release checks if any of your wallet contracts is vulnerable and urges you to move your funds to a new wallet.\n\nThis is a recommended update!\n**You should NOT use wallet contracts from before homestead, OR the owner accounts of these wallet contracts until you moved the funds to a secure wallet!**\n\nFor more information about the vulnerability read here: https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/security-alert-smart-contract-wallets-created-in-frontier-are-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks\n\n## Steps to secure your funds\n\n### Check which wallets are vulnerable\n\n![screen shot 2016-06-24 at 12 27 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/232662/16335894/7ebd3126-3a09-11e6-877d-f163a0e923d0.png)\n\n### Click the red notification to create a

contract!\n\n<img width=\"967\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-24 at 12 33 21\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/232662/16335803/feb77202-3a08-11e6-96a4-03df6267c83e.png\">\n\n### Check if funds arrived at the new wallet, and write down the wallet address!\n\nSeriously, write down your wallet address, and also backup your keystore (Main Menu -> Accounts -> Backup)\n\n<img width=\"584\"

your owner accounts as well.\n\n![screen shot 2016-06-24 at 12 35 58](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/232662/16335813/10f5a84e-3a09-11e6-9ec9-bbfa2293dbe0.png)\n\nAfter that you can use your wallet and your owner accounts again! But you should always be aware that interacting with unknown contracts can be dangerous!\n\nCHECKSUMS:\n\n```\nSHA256 Ethereum-Wallet-linux64-0-7-6.zip:

light grey progress bar is part of many improvements to sync](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/16086732/ebde9fc0-32f6-11e6-8ccf-aa70cb4beb7f.png)\n\n### Faster sync, stability improvements, more robust node\n\nThis update has been a long time coming. A lot of things happened in the last weeks that created this delay: geth had not only one, but two vulnerabilities found at the same time that it released with a lot of internal changes to the way the wallet synced and connected to the IPC. We were starting a new team (welcome @hiddentao, @evertonfraga and @luclu) and I was pushing for weekly releases, without proper testing. Meanwhile the DAO happened, and we wanted to make a release that had support for events subscription without realizing the performance impact it would have. All that converged into having a couple of crappy releases where many users were having to downgrade to 0.6.2 just to be able to do small and simple tasks. As a result, we decided to hold off on any new releases until we were sure we could have the stable and usable Wallet we believe the community deserves.\n\nBut finally, we feel that this version arrived. Ram has worked hard on refactoring the logic behind the node connection to make it more resilient and stable. Bas has worked a lot with to adopt the changes to the Geth IPC connection, which should allow other nodes to be more easily integrated in the future. Fabian refactored the whole event subscription so that you only Luca and Ev have worked in a ton of smaller issues that combined were creating an overall bad experience. I've refactored a lot of the splash screen and onboarding logic. All this, together with a brand new sync by the geth team and specially the fast sync by @karalabe result in a much more stable and fast wallet. Even if you have already downloaded the blockchain before, I suggest you try downloading it from scratch again as an experience: Peter reported being able to sync from scratch in less than 30 minutes using a SSD, while my experience, from a not so great connection in south america, was a full sync in about 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nIf you had downloaded the wallet in any point in the past and had issues syncing, sending transactions or a constant wrong password message, I highly recommend you give the wallet a second try. Even if it's not perfect I'm sure it's a lot better. \n\nWe are also working to streamline and optimize our release process, including some automated UI testing for electron, and at the same time all of those improvements were some great stride forwards on the Mist Browser itself, which we hope to be able to release a preview soon (no dates promised though).\n\n#### Checksums\n\n```\nshasum Ethereum-Wallet-win32-0-7-5.zip: e6b07b174aeb777f2aeec44378e270025904489d\nshasum Ethereum-Wallet-linux64-0-7-5.zip: 5ce69e3fe9b8d04fbb47bcba7c7fce8729484fb6\nshasum Ethereum-Wallet-linux32-0-7-5.zip: 7a07b9dc737fa8c0abc57aca82e1eff8774673f3\nshasum Ethereum-Wallet-macosx-0-7-5.zip: 244162798a176ff576d56ddd23d577efd1d88f12\nshasum Ethereum-Wallet-win64-0-7-5.zip: 5e241adf4d6362a946f92f3666e0d6aeb16bc9c8\n```\n\n#### Known issues\n- The latest version has issues connecting to the latest Eth nodes\n- While running the wallet in Mist mode on the command line, you'll see some icons and images missing\n- If you close the window during sync, the app will stay running in the background and won't quit. Close the app using the keyboard shortcuts\n\n#### Full Changelog\n- Changes the way event subscriptions occur, now only downloading events and logs when requested, per watched contract. This was severely impacting the wallet - especially with very active contracts like The DAO \n- Added unlock and send (#700) aka \"two second unlock vulnerability\"\n- Fixed incorrect total token balance (ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet#206 and #608 )\n- Fixed broken clipboard-functionality on the main-net (https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet/pull/192)\n- Check for update at startup and inform the user if a new version is available (#707)\n- Pass custom CLI options to the Ethereum node (#689)\n- Updated nodes to latest version of geth ([1.4.7](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.4.7)) and eth ([1.2.9](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/releases/tag/v1.2.9))\n- Upgrade code to latest version of Electron (#811)\n- Korean Translation (#645)\n- Norwegian Bokmål translation (#705)\n- Italian translation (#768)\n- Improvements to the French translation\n- Node startup and synchronization improvements (#559)\n- Sync is much more resilient now and auto-restarts if node changes\n- Fix how we detect whether eth has started up, remove nodeConnector\n- Ensure can switch network type while syncing\n- Improved how we determine splash screen status messages.

The details on the security issues are [described on this blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/05/17/security-alert-geth-suffers-from-a-very-low-probable-dos-attack-vector-update-immediately/).\n\nThis is the first release to include geth 1.4 wich should come with some performance improvements and connection fixes. \n\n---\n\n### New from 0.7:\n\nThis is a small but very special release. First, and foremost it's the first release with contributions from our new team members: Ramesh Nair (@hiddentao), Everton Fraga (@evertonfraga) and Luca Zeug (@luclu). With our new hires we hope to be shift the focus slowly from adding features to the Ethereum Wallet and focus more on Mist Browser, the target of the next big Ethereum Milestone, Metropolis. We will write more about the new roadmap for mist and how the new team members fit into that, but for the moment, let's talk about this release:\n- On version 0.7.x we added Contract Events to our logs, which would allow users to watch contracts for any event logged. At each new block the wallet reads not only the new events, but goes back a few blocks and checks them again, in case there was a network split. We knew there was a very [proeminent crowdsale](https://daohub.org) that would benefit from it, but we never expected it would be as popular as it became. As a result, at each block the wallet was doing over 10k local database reads and writes, therefore causing the interface to stop responding and sometimes lose connection to the database. This bug was behind the dreaded \"invalid date\" error that affected many of our users.\n- A lot of the logging and startup sequence has been rewritten, to avoid common sync errors on startup and make bug diagnostics more effective.\n- New traditional chinese translation has been added, as well as improvements to french and spanish translations. All of these are from members of the community and we are grateful for everyone. If you want to make a translation or help on our current ones, here are the links you'll need:\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/mist/blob/develop/interface/i18n/app.en.i18n.json\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/mist/blob/develop/interface/i18n/mist.en.i18n.json\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet/blob/develop/app/i18n/app.en.i18n.json\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet/blob/develop/app/i18n/wallet.en.i18n.json\n- Keyboard shortcuts have been changed to avoid conflicts, typos and many other smaller bug fixes.\n\nThese should fix most recent issues, but you still have trouble launching or running the wallet and you feel you **must** do it this week, we recommend you try these, in order:\n- If you are watching _The DAO_ we recommend you stop watching it for now, at least while it's so popular. You can still send ether to it, if that's your intention. On our testings, even if the performance has improved, watching the DAO still hangs the wallet occasionally.\n- If you can't even launch the wallet to remove it, try downloading and running (no need to uninstall or delete anything) the Wallet [version 0.6.2](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/tag/0.6.2), stop watching and then launch the newest one (or use the older version for a while).\n- If you still have the \"Invalid Date\" error or is stuck at \"Waiting for blocks\" for a long period of time, then you might have a corrupted database and might need to sync it again. Go to your Ethereum folder (access it via accounts > backup > accounts), delete (or simply rename) the folder chain data and start the app again.\n- [Create an

Add German (thanks to @ColRad) and Portuguese (@alexvandesande) translation for the wallet!\n- Added log infos to the splash screen, so users can see what the node is currently doing...\n- Improved ether display precision on the confirmation screen\n- Added a check with NTP servers to see if the computer time is correct, if not it shows an error\n- Increased error timeout\n\nIf you should notice that your wallet links lead to a white page, please run the following script in the console:\nhttps://gist.github.com/frozeman/ed41008f4d30900da3e8\nThis changes all your wallet addresses internally back to lowercase (we introduced that by accident).\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-11 at 13 46

is a small bug fix update on Beta 8, released yesterday and is the latest Homestead Ready wallet.\n\nFixes in this version:\n- Adds an About screen \n- Fixes an issue where it didn't select the right account when clicking \"send\" from an accounts page\n- Fixed the importing of wallet contracts\n- Fixes an issue with the checksum and shape shift \n- Fixes an issue where old tokens where being removed\n- Fixes some bugs in the import presale wallet. We also added more specific error reporting so we can identify an issue some users are having with importing the presale wallet\n- Fixes an issue with wrong cost estimate of token sending\n\nChanges in this Beta 8:\n- Supports Go-ethereum **Homestead edition**\n- Implements address checksum to ensure address validity\n- Fixes a  [sync issue with windows](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/195#issuecomment-187128777) \n- Fixes a very common bug that [would prevent the wallet to start in MacOSX](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/163)\n- Wallets are now deployed full for now, so they cost more but have not those bugs described [here](http://www.kingoftheether.com/postmortem.html) (e.g. no stub contract is used). This will be fixed after homestead, after which we then can deploy stubs properly again.\n- Fixes some interface issues\n\n**Note: `eth` isn't bundled on OSX with the Ethereum-Wallet, but that you can start an eth node before starting Mist, and the wallet will connect to it.**\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-03 at 12 59

This doesn't mean it's bug free, but it's certainly the more stable release we've ever done as it fixes some very common bugs. We also did our best attempts to when it fails, it fails gracefully, communicating to the user how to proceed to fix it. Many critical issues of the wallet are already identified and have been fixed on a deluge of fixes coming on geth after homestead, including much faster sync and download times.\n\nChanges in this version:\n- Supports Go-ethereum **Homestead edition**\n- Implements address checksum to ensure address validity\n- Fixes a  [sync issue with windows](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/195#issuecomment-187128777) \n- Fixes a very common bug that [would prevent the wallet to start in MacOSX](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/163)\n- Wallets are now deployed full for now, so they cost more but have not those bugs described [here](http://www.kingoftheether.com/postmortem.html) (e.g. no stub contract is used).

latest geth 1.3.3 node and doing some improvements in the contract execution based on user feedback.\n- Updates geth to the latest version\n- Contract variable and function names that are either CamelCased or with underlines on the name are displayed with space separation, to make them easier to read\n- Adds some naive auto detection of timestamps, displaying the _time since_ when detects them. \n- Renames true and false to Yes and No and adds checkmark\n- Adds 100k extra gas to all transactions above the gas cost estimate\n- Naive detection of out of gas transactions\n- Fixed an issue that prevented multiple contract executions one after the other\n\n**Note** Linux 32 and Windows 32, don't come with a node shipped.

is the released contains all the features [demoed at Devcon1](https://youtu.be/BUARih8_f68?t=23m14s) and it's mostly centered around contract execution. We also took a lot of feedback that felt the previous beta was starting to show signs of [featuritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feature_creep) so we simplified and streamlined the app.\n\n![screen shot 2015-11-25 at 6 32 01 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/11408836/da79f7f0-93a2-11e5-995d-01c41e9caf8b.png)\n- All contract upload and token management are under the \"contracts\" tab, which you can safely ignore if you just want to store ether (This will move into its own Dapp in the future, once Mist comes along)\n- You can watch a contract and interact with it by adding its address and JSON Interface. In the future the JSON Interface will be stored on IPFS/Swarm so it might be retrieved directly from the address, but right now you'll need both. \n- Contracts you deploy yourself will be automatically saved to your \"Custom Contracts\" so you won't need to bother with the JSON Interface. If it looks like a token, we'll automatically add to your token list too.\n- Fast sync is now enabled, so if you are syncing **from block 0** you'll experience dramatically shorter sync times, on your first sync. Later syncs will still take a while, bit once you catched up its significantly less.\n- Mac, Linux 64Bit and Win 64Bit versions come with `geth` built in. Mac and Wind 64Bit comes also with `eth`. If you are working on a different implementation and are interested in embedding your version with the wallet, [come talk to us on the gitter room](https://gitter.im/ethereum/mist?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)\n\nAnd just like previous versions, you don't need to open the command line or install anything to run this app. We hope this version makes interacting with smart contracts even easier and more fun than ever before.\n\n### Example contracts:\n\nYou can test a complete DAO with [these contracts](http://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/?gist=bed9b7b38843aef27241), by following these steps:\n- [Get the code to create a Custom Token](http://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/?gist=20c8b5658349b003b08d): sonf go to contracts > deploy new contract\n- Use 10000 as the `_supply`, 2 as `_decimals` and `%` as the symbol. Click **deploy** and wait a few seconds for your code to be picked up. \n- Now go to the contract page (its on the \"latest transaction\" table on the dashboard or on the Contracts page) and click \"copy address to clipboard\". Save that somewhere.\n- [Get the code to create a DAO](http://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/?gist=6c489fe759b27c7a2669): and paste it on the contracts > deploy new contract page.\n- Use the address you saved earlier as the `sharesAddress`, put 1000 on `minimumSharesForVoting` to reject any proposal that doesn't have at least 10% of shares behind it and put any number you want on `minutesForDebate`. If you just want to do a quick test, use a small amount like 5-30, but if you actually want it at least a week of full debates before any proposal can be executed, then put 10000 or more.\n- Click deploy and wait a few seconds for the transaction to be picked up\n- Go to the contract page and click \"show contract info\". You can read all the information about the contract on the left column. \n- Pick `newProposal`. Add the recipient you want to receive the ether, the amount and a string. If you want it to execute some code, add the contract data on the last box. Click \"execute\".\n- Pick `vote`. Select the user that you want to vote with, the proposal number and click \"YES\" if you support the proposal.\n- Pick `executeProposal`. Proposals can only be executed if the minimum amount of time to vote has passed and if enough users have voted to surpass the minimum quorum. Choose the proposal number, click \"execute\" and it will count up the votes. If it passes it will send the amount asked and execute the

release fixes a lot of bugs and adds a new custom Token system, as well as a simple way to deploy contracts right from the wallet!\n\nTo update from a previous beta, just replace the old version with the new one. The actual important data is stored in your application data folder (see readme).\n\n**This new version will update your database, so the first start of the wallet may take a while. Please be patient.**\n\n**Note** This release contains [geth 1.3.1](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.3.1), so make sure to also upgrade your installed node as well (if you have one installed), otherwise you will corrupt your blockchain data switching between the different versions!\n\n## Contract deployment\n\nWith this version you will also be able to conveniently deploy contracts from solidity code and provide their constructor parameters as well. Simple go to the \"Send\" page and click \"Deploy contract\":\n\n![screen shot 2015-11-02 at 11 49 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/232662/10879996/db61d488-8157-11e5-9fb4-914241aa2834.png)\n\n## Example\n\nChoose your sender and put the solidity code for your contract in the main text field. The app will check for errors and then fill the right fields with the starting parameters for your contracts. In this [this example of a token](http://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/?gist=909d02feff3a2e59f714) the starting parameters are:\n- Initial supply, the amount of the token that will be issued to the creator of the contract\n- A string representing a short name for the token (\"My token\")\n- A string representing a symbol for the token (ie. \"MT$\"). Those are not checked to be unique in any way.\n- How many decimal places your token has to the smallest divisible part. For example, if you want your token to divisible by at most 100 smaller (nameless) units, then put \"2\". Under the hood the system always deals with the smallest unit in integers.\n\nExample: You want to create a entity with \"virtual shares\", with the minimum for trading is the 0.001%. Then use **100000** as the _supply_, your virtual company name as the _name_, \"%\" as _symbol_ and 3 as _decimals_. This will result in the creator of the contract owning  \"100.000%\" of your tokens, with a contract that can be proven will never be able to create any more shares.\n\n**This example is given as an educational tool for building virtual assets on the blockchain, check your local regulation to understand how these virtual assets are considered and regulated, as you probably won't be able to legally issue real shares**.\n\nPress send, type your password and you'll be redirected to your dashboard. There you'll probably see a transaction log stating that you created a contract. The contract address will be visible after a few seconds, after the transaction has confirmed.\n\n<img width=\"754\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-11-02 at 9 46 19 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/10881003/a79430c6-8146-11e5-9433-6da311eaa94c.png\">\n\nClick the transaction and copy the address:\n\n![screen shot 2015-11-02 at 9 47 31 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/10881031/c771e5be-8146-11e5-9a19-eb77f6669e26.png)\n\n## Custom tokens\n\nTo add a custom token, click the \"Token\" button in the upper right. This lists all the contract tokens that you are currently watching for transactions. Click \"add token\" and then paste the address of the token you just created (or any token you want to keep in your wallet).\n\n![screen shot 2015-11-02 at 10 01 50 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/10881319/d6d4d94c-8148-11e5-9a45-093132f3e8dd.png)\n\nThe wallet will then watch the token and check if one of your addresses has any balance. \n\n![screen shot 2015-11-02 at 11 46 09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/232662/10879922/53fdefb8-8157-11e5-9307-a7f222abc767.png)\n\nTo send tokens around, just go to the send page, and pick the sender and receiver as you would do with a normal ether transaction but instead of ether, pick your token. If you don't see the token you want to send in this list, then that means that either your sender account doesn't have any of it, or that your wallet hasn't synced up. Pay attention to the token icon, as this is the unique identifier of your contract and is linked to its address. Tokens can have any names or symbols (including \"US dollar\" or \"BTC\" and other token names) but each one will have a single unique icon, this is your guarantee of sending and receiving the token you want.\n\n![screen shot 2015-11-02 at 10 10 59 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/112898/10881469/0cf9345e-814a-11e5-842b-cae1adf09de5.png)\n\nIf you have any issues please post them to the [wallet repository](https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet/issues).\n\nApps:\n- Mac OSX (nodes included)\n- Windows 64Bit (nodes included)\n- Windows 32Bit\n- Linux 64Bit (nodes

release fixes mainly the Ghost Wallet bug (Where you would receive transactions from anybody after a wallet creation).\n\n_We have now also bundled linux 64-bit nodes into the wallet, so now Mac, Windows and Linux 64-bit come with a bundled node._\n\nAdditionally it adds some small performance and layout improvements.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nDon't forget to post issues in the [wallet repo](https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet/issues)\n"}]
