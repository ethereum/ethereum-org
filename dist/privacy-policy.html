work can be found at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called
cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>
<p>Through the use of cookies, the Foundation can provide the users of this website
with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie
setting.</p>
<p>Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our websites users. The
purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our websites. The websites user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the websites is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.</p>
<p>You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our websites by means
of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently
deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, previously set cookies may be deleted at
any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, it may not be possible to use all the functions of our websites.</p>

address be sent to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there. In these
cases, we provide contractual guarantees to ensure that Google Inc. maintains a
sufficient level of data protection. According to Google Inc., under no circumstances will the IP address be associated with any other user-related data.
