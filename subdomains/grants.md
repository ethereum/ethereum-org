# Applying to Ethereum Foundation's grant programs

The Ethereum Foundation invites applications for funding for building a useful product or experience.  Projects that receive a Ethereum Foundation grant must no ICO or no token sale.

We provide Ethereum teams with more runway, advice and resources to focus simply on building useful products and experiences.


Ethereum Foundation grantees receive:
* Non-dilutive funding
* Technical advisory
* Connection to more users
* Platform to share your work


It's possible for grant winners to receive subsequent funding from the Ethereum Foundation when milestones are achieved. We believe this will provide tight feedback loops for impact to the ecosystem.

## Individual Hackternships

Outside of organizational grants, Ethereum gives out $10,000 for 10 weeks for people who have specific projects in mind.   Successful projects will be featured at a developer conference.  We are also looking to hire and fund from this pool of side projects.  All hackernship work must be opensource.
In addition to funding, all accepted applications win a limited edition [t-shirt](https://swag.ethereum.org)!
